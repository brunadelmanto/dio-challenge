# Dio Challenge
*Dio JAVA Bootcamp learning, February 2023*

Hello! My name is Bruna, I'm a Brazilian Bachelor's degree student in Information Technology, 28 years old. 

My current goal is to start my career as a back-end developer in the technology field, so this is a personal repository dedicated to educational use so that I can describe all the learnings gained from the **JAVA Bootcamp** offered by DIO starting in February 2023. :yellow_heart:

*Observation: The use of the English language is because it is a way for me to improve my language.*
